# What I Have Learnt & Need to Work On:

## Unit 01 Session 01 - Introduction to Software Development
As a beginner to the world of software development I have gained understanding in learning about the different stages in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), which covers key areas of Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing & Intergration and Maintainence; in this area I learnt that through out  the lifecycle testing throughout is important and a continuous process. Aside from the SDLC I have learnt about the different SDLC Methodologies Which are to help manage and level out complexities; Methodoliges include Waterfall, Spiral, Rapid, Agile, and Incremental. This area including Frameworks of Scrum, Kanban and XP is what I need to gain more familiarity on.


## Unit 01 Session 02 - Introduction to Software Development
In this session I really enjoyed learning about the different branches within software development such as Web Application Development, Software Engineering, and Video Game Development; Software Development is based around computer programs for desktop and mobile devices. I understood importance of the different branches and roles especially within full stack, front end development, and back end developement (which is covered in web development); I learned that front end developers (known as 'client side') are responsible for the design function and user interface of a website, mobile device, and apps. Back end development (known as 'server side') is responsible for basically how the user interface functions, and is made up of the database and server of the website, mobile device or app. Full stack developers are responsible for front end and back end systems using both sides languages. Other than this I learned about Source Control (also know as version control) which is used in development and is used in tracking and managing changes source code; examples of this system is Github and AWS Code Commit. It is a key component in development projects to help teams work more faster and efficiently. In this session I need to work more on getting familiar with the Source Control of Github.


## Unit 01 Session 03 - Command Line & Git
This is where I began to get more hands on! Command lines are a user interface that is navigated by typing commands at prompts, such as Terminal for MacOS and Windows Command Line (the commands of these two usually differ from each other). I learned that Commands on a command line work by typing or pasting them on each line using abbreviations, e.g. 'cd' - change directiory, and 'mkdir' - make a directory. The instructions of the command line is then sent to the computer for the command to work. Command lines are useful in many ways which include, connecting with source controls, such as Git and having more control over system functions. On the other hand we have we covered the source control system of Git, it is accessed on through s command line or Terminal and keeps different source code codebases to build a software. Git is a tool (which can be confused with GitHub if one is unfamiliar with it - Github is a cloud-based hosting platform for Git's source control system which can be used together) that is useful in different ways especially to fix bugs and track the changes in code. In this session I need to work on getting more familiar with manouvering around Terminal and practicing with different commands on a command line.


## Unit 01 Session 04 - Git & GitHub
This was a fairly challenging session, but I eventusaly got there in the end. I learned how to initialise a Git repository, add files, make a commit, and add branches. Here are some git commands I learned below:

To list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed - **git status**

Initalising a git turns a directory into a git repository - **git init**

To add a file or changes is also known as staging - **git add . (all files)** & **git add example.txt**

Making official or 'taking a snapshot' of a file or files changes - **git commit**, **git commit -a** for all changes, **git commit -m "commit message"** for a shortcut to skip a step 

A branch is a new line of development aside and departs from the main branch - **git branch new-branch**

To delete a branch in a repository - **git branch -d branch name**

To list the files in a repository - **git branch -v branch name**

To switch to a new branch - **git checkout**

To switch to create and switch to a new branch at the same time - **git checkout -b another branch**

To merge a branch and its files into the main branch - **git merge new branch**

On GitHub I found the area of learning how to push and pull changes, and creating a remote repository a little challenging, but I know this is an area I need further practice on.
